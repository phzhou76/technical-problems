/**
 * Problem: Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two 
 * singly-linked lists begins.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	1. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 *	2. The linked lists must retain their original structure after the method
 *		returns.
 *	3. You may assume that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked
 *		list structure.
 *	4. Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
