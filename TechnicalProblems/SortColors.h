/**
 * Problem: Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
 * in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in
 * the order of red, white, or blue. 
 *
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent red, white, and blue,
 * respectively. 
 * 
 * Notes:
 *	1. You cannot use a sort algorithm for this problem.
 *	2. A straightforward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
 *		First, iterate through the array counting the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s,
 *		and then overwrite the array with the total numbers of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
 *	3. Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
