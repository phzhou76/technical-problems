/**
 * Problem: Given a binary tree in which each node has a left, right, and next
 * pointer, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there
 * is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to null.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to null.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	1. You may only use constant extra space.
 *	2. Recursive approaches are fine - the implicit stack space does not count as
 *		extra space for this problem.

	/* Algorithm:
	 *	1. Create two tree node pointers:
	 *		1a. One pointer holds the start of the next level (the leftmost node
	 *			in that level).
	 *		1b. Other pointer will hold the previously visited child. We need to
	 *			know which child was visited last on that level to create a link.
	 *			Note that this pointer must be set to null at the end of each
	 *			level.
	 *	2. Have the pointer that holds the start of the next level begin at the
	 *		root node.
	 *	3. While there is still a leftmost pointer (i.e. while there is still a
	 *		next level in the tree to visit):
	 *		3a. First, set the leftmost pointer to null so that the first child
	 *			node we find can set it. If there is no child node (i.e. we are
	 *			on the last level of this tree), then this pointer will stay null
	 *			and the loop will end.
	 *		3b. Then, start a current node pointer at the leftmost node in the
	 *			level, and continue until it points to null:
	 *			3ba. If the left child of the current node exists, connect the
	 *				previously seen node to it (if it exists), and set the left
	 *				child as the previously seen node. Also, check to see if the
	 *				child is the leftmost node of the next level.
	 *			3bb. If the right child of the current node exists, connect the
	 *				previously seen node to it (if it exists), and set the right
	 *				child as the previously seen node. Also, check to see if the
	 *				child is the leftmost node of the next level.
	 *			3bc. Increment the current node pointer by using the next field.
	 *		3c. Set the previously visited child node to null to reset it.
