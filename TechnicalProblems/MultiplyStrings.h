 * Problem: Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings,
 * return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	1. The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
 *	2. Both num1 and num2 contain only diigts 0-9.
 *	3. Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zeroes, except for the number
 *		0 itself.
 *	4. You cannot convert the inputs to integer directly.
