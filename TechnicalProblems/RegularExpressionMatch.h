/**
 * Problem: Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression
 * matching with support for '.' and '*'.
 *
 * Pattern Rules:
 *	1. '*' matches 0 or more occurrences of the characters before '*'.
 *	2. '.' matches any single character.
 *	3. '.*' matches 0 or more occurrences of any character. (E.g. 'ab' matches '.*').
 *
 * The entire string should match the pattern.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	1. s could be empty, and only contains lowercase letters a-z.
 *	2. p could be empty, and only contains lowercase letters a-z, '.', and '*'.
 *
 * Return true if the string s matches the pattern p, false if it doesn't.

	/* Dynamic Programming Solution:
	 *
	 * Create a 2D matrix T of boolean values of rows equal to the length of the
	 * string + !, and columns equal to the length of the pattern + 1.
	 *
	 * Then, at element T[i][j] in the matrix, where i is the current char in the
	 * string being examined, and j is the current char in the pattern being matched
	 * against:
	 *	1. If T[i][j] is true, then the substring in s ending at the ith char
	 *		matches the pattern in p ending at the jth char.
	 *	2. If T[i][j] is false, then the substring in s ending at the ith char
	 *		does not match the pattern in p ending at the jth char.
	 *
	 * Cases:
	 *	1. If str[i] == pattern[j] OR if pattern[j] == '.', then have T[i][j]
	 *		take on the value at T[i - 1][j - 1]. This is because if the current
	 *		char in the string matches the current char in the pattern, we just
	 *		need to determine if the string up to before the current char matched
	 *		the pattern up to before the current pattern char.
	 *
	 *		If the previous substring was a match, then the previous substring
	 *		plus this char is a match. If the previous substring wasn't a match,
	 *		then the previous substring plus this char won't be a match.
	 *
	 *	2. If the current char in the pattern is a wildcard (pattern[j] == '*'),
	 *		then there are two subcases that we need to check.
	 *
	 *		2a. Assume that there are zero occurrences of the wildcard pattern
	 *			for now. Then, take a look at whether or not the string until the
	 *			current char matches the pattern before the wildcard pattern.
	 *			This is located at T[i][j - 2].
	 *	
	 *		2b. Then, see if there is at least one occurrence of the wildcard
	 *			pattern. See if the current char matched the previous pattern
	 *			char (since that specifies the intake for the wildcard). 
	 *
	 *			If this previous pattern char (pattern[j - 2]) matches the current
	 *			char or if it contains '.', then we can assume that at least one
	 *			occurrence exists for the wildcard pattern.
	 *
	 *			Then, we can see if the string up until before the current char
	 *			matches the wildcard pattern. This is located at T[i - 1][j].
	 *
	 *		2c. At least one of the two conditions (0 occurrences or 1+ occurrences)
	 *			must be true for T[i][j] to be true. (2a || 2b)
	 *
	 *	3. If neither of the above two conditions match, then we will set this
	 *		to false, since the current char couldn't possibly match the current
	 *		char in the pattern.
