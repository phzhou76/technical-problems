	/* First, create an integer that holds the global maximum found so far. Then,
	 * create two integer values, one that holds the minimum product found so far,
	 * and the other that holds the maximum product found so far.
	 *
	 * The idea is that if a negative number does exist in the array, the minimum
	 * value will hold a negative value, while the maximum value will hold a positive
	 * value. If another negative value exists, then multiplying the minimum value
	 * by that negative value could make it the maximum value. On the other hand,
	 * multiplying the maximum value by that negative value could make it the
	 * minimum value.
	 *
	 * Have the minimum and maximum start out at the first value. Then, loop from
	 * the 2nd number onwards to the last number in the array. If the current
	 * number is negative, then we need to swap the minimum and maximum values to
	 * account for the following:
	 *
	 *	1. Multiplying max * negative (if max is positive) could result in lowest
	 *		min value.
	 *
	 *	2. Multiplying min * negative (if min is negative) could result in highest
	 *		max value.
