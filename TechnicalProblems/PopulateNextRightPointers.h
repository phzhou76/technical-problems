/**
 * Problem: Given a binary tree where each node in the tree has a left, right,
 * and next pointer, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node.
 * If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to null.
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to null.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	1. You may only use constant extra space.
 *	2. Recursive approach is fine - implicit stack space does not count as extra
 *		space for this problem.
 *	3. You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (i.e. all leaves are at
 *		the same level, and every parent has two children.

	 * the input is a perfect binary tree means that we know the following:

	 *	2. The first, or leftmost, node in each level can be obtained by taking
	 *		the leftmost node in the previous level and obtaining its left child. 
	 *
	 * With that in mind, we'll take the leftmost node in each level, starting
	 * from the root, and ending at the level before the leaf nodes. Use the
	 * leftmost node in each level as the starting point, and for each node in
	 * the level (accessed with the next field), do the following:
	 *	1. Connect the current node's left child to its right child.
	 *	2. If the current node isn't the last node on its level (this can be 
	 *		checked with node->right != null), then connect this node's right
	 *		child to the next node's left child.
	 *	3. Iterate on to the node to the right. 
	 *
	 * The next field will be guaranteed to be set for currNode, since the previous
	 * level's iteration must have set it, starting from the root setting the next
	 * level's next fields. */
