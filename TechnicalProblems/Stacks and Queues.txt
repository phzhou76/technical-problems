Stacks:

Stacks are data structures that use LIFO (last-in, first-out) ordering. It does
not provide constant time access to any element, but does offer contant time
insertions to and deletions from the top of the stack. 

Operations:
	1. pop() - Removes the item on top of the stack.
	2. push(item) - Adds an item to the top of the stack.
	3. peek() - Returns a reference to the item on top of the stack.
	4. isEmpty() - Returns true if the stack is empty.

Note: Just like how function calls are placed onto a call stack for recursive
calls, stacks can be used to implement iterative algorithms recursively within the
same function.

Stacks can be implemented with linked lists by pushing to and popping from either 
the head or tail of the linked list.


Queues:

Queues are data structures that use FIFO (first-in, first-out) ordering. Like
stacks, it does not provide constant time access to any element, but does offer
constant time insertions to the back and deletions from the front of the queue.

Operations:
	1. add(item) - Adds an item to the end of the queue.
	2. remove() - Removes the item from the front of the queue.
	3. peek() - Returns the front of the queue.
	4. isEmpty() - Returns true if the queue is empty.

Note: Queues are often used in algorithms involving breadth-first search or caches.

Queues can be implemented with linked lists by adding to and removing from opposite
ends of the linked list.
