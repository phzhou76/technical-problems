Bit Manipulation:

& - The AND operation.
| - The OR operation.
^ - The XOR operation.
~ - The NOT operation.

Tips and Tricks:
	1. If two of the same bit values are added together, it's equal to multiplying
		one of the values by 2. In that case, just shift the bits of one of the
		values over by 1, since that is equivalent to multiplying by 2. For example,
		1001 + 1001 is equal to 2 * 1001, or 1001 << 1.
	2. If a bit value is being multiplied by a value that only has one bit set to
		1 (a 2^x value, where x is a number), shift the bit value to the right by
		x bits. For example, 1000 * 1011 is equal to 2^3 * 1011, or 1011 << 3.
	3. Any value XORed with its negated value is equal to all 1s. For example,
		1101 ^ ~1101 = 1111.
	4. Can zero out the last x bits by negating 0, shifting that result x bits to
		the right, and ANDing the result with the input bit value. For example,
		1101 & (~0 << 3) is 1000.

Other Tips and Tricks:
	1. x ^ 0000.. = x
		a. Explanation: 1 ^ 0 is 1, and 0 ^ 0 is 0, so x ^ 0000.. will just preserve
			the bits of the original value.
	2. x ^ 1111.. = ~x
		a. Explanation: 1 ^ 1 is 0, and 0 ^ 1 is 1, so x ^ 1111.. will invert each
			bit in the original value.
	3. x ^ x = 0
		a. Explanation: 1 ^ 1 is 0, and 0 ^ 0 is 0, so x ^ x will cancel each bit
			out and set it to 0.
	4. x & 0000.. = 0
		a. Explanation: Any bit AND 0 is 0, so x & 0000.. will set all bits to 0.
	5. x & 1111.. = x
		a. Explanation: 1 & 1 is 1, and 0 & 1 is 0, so x & 1111.. will not change
			any of the bits in the original value.
	6. x & x = x
		a. Explanation: 1 & 1 is 1, and 0 & 0 is 0, so x & x will not change any
			of the bits in the original value.
	7. x | 0000.. = x
		a. Explanation: 1 | 0 is 1, and 0 | 0 is 0, so x | 0000.. will not change
			any of the bits in the original value.
	8. x | 1111.. = 1111..
		a. Explanation: 1 | 1 is 1, and 0 | 1 is 1, so x | 1111.. will set all of
			the bits to 1.
	9. x | x = x
		a. Explanation: 1 | 1 is 1, and 0 | 0 is 0, so x | x will not change any
			of the bits in the original value.
